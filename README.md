# AntiMagicSquare Bruteforce Algorithm
This is a bruteforce algorithm to find all possible layouts of valid solutions in a variation of an anti-magic square. This anti-magic square's diagonals, horizontals, and verticals must have unique sums (not necessary consecutive sums) to create a valid solution. The aim of these puzzles is to complete one using the least amount of unique numbers (numbers can repeat in the square as much as needed). The algorithm finds every possible solution - if there is one.
